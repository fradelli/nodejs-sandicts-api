# Code Style Pattern

## Purpose

Keep implementation intent visible in code.

For function, command, query, hook, and file naming, follow the shared
`fradelli/sandicts-docs:docs/engineering/code-semantics.md` guideline. It owns
side-effect naming, meaningful query filters, and prototype/API vocabulary
boundaries for both apps. The rules below remain the local constant and
helper-placement baseline.

## Magic Numbers And Unclear Literals

Do not leave non-obvious numeric literals inline when the value represents a
domain rule, unit conversion, timeout, TTL, byte length, rate limit, status
threshold, layout implementation value, or validation boundary.

Prefer a semantic constant or helper:

- `millisecondsPerSecond` instead of inline `1000`
- `addSeconds(date, ttlSeconds)` instead of `date.getTime() + ttlSeconds * 1000`
- `googleSignInRateLimit` instead of inline throttle `20`
- `minimumGoogleIdTokenLength` instead of inline schema `.min(10)`
- `sandictsMarkSizePx` instead of repeated JSX `width={44}` and `height={44}`

Allowed inline values:

- `0` and `1` when they are obvious counters, array indexes, or boolean-like
  thresholds in a local expression
- HTTP status codes when wrapped by framework constants such as `HttpStatus.OK`
- Tailwind utility scale classes such as `px-4`, `gap-8`, and `text-5xl`
- package versions, documented examples, ports in user-facing docs, generated
  code, and literal fixture data where the literal is the scenario itself

When in doubt, name the value close to where it is used. Extract to a shared
helper only after repetition appears or the value represents a cross-cutting
concept such as time conversion.

## Local Constants And Helpers

Prefer local sibling files over broad utility buckets when a value or helper is
specific to one module or adapter.

Use:

- `feature-name.constants.ts` for catalogs, allowed values, or reusable literals
- `feature-name.types.ts` for exported structural types
- `feature-name.helpers.ts` for small predicates, guards, or local calculations
- `feature-name.mapper.ts` for translating between layers

Avoid:

- `utils.ts` or `helpers.ts` files that collect unrelated functions
- moving domain-specific constants to `shared` only because another file imports them
- mixing public contracts, persistence helpers, and mappers in the same file
